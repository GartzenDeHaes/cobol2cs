Required 4 Production Screen Conversion

1. Secure the java servlet calls.
3.  Add decimal to WsRecord relational operators.
4.  Need unit test for NATIVE-4, NATIVE-2.

Desirable Features

1. Support SHADOWED BY PGFD-START-DATE-SB OF AL-VIEWCANC-SHADOW-REPLY(?)
5. Generate java interfaces for COBOL servers; change server interfaces to 
   make local or remote calls.
6. Support TURN TEMP REVERSE?
7. Generate textbox input filters based on the PIC format.
8. Support WHEN ABSENT attribute?
9. Support TURN NOUNDERLINE/UNDERLINE?
10. Add support for batch programs.
   - IoRecord Write isn't correct for files.
      "WRITE F50-REL-ERROR-REC FROM W99-RPT-ENDING-TIME-LN AFTER 2"
11. Perserve whitespace of the original program.
12. Support MOVE SPACES TO TRA-STATUS-LIT OF WS-TRA-LINE (WS-SUB, WS-COL-SUB).

General Issues

•	Programs with transactions need some rework to use batch updates instead
of transactions.

•	The converted programs are highly resistant to refactoring, which 
prevents incremental removal of the COBOL semantics.

•	Data intensive screens require optimization after conversion.

•	SQL/MP INTERVAL not supported in resultsets, i.e., you can't return it in a query.

•	TURN on screen fields with OCCURES clause not supported.
